## Story Description
- In this project, I was tasked with sharing a story from my life in the form of pictures. Growing up in the heart of LA, I have grown up to be quite a foodie, and I wanted my story to reflect that. My story covers different foodies I had in 2024, having four foods each month. I used two different String 2D arrays. One to store the names of all the foods, and another to store the ratings of all the foods I ate.

## Image Filter Description & Analyzation
- For this project, I focused on using two filters; coloization and motion blur. Colorization changes the color of an image based on the original grayscale values. "The grayscale value of each pixel is converted to a hue value, which is then used to apply a specific color to the pixel." For motion blur, stimualtes the effect of motion into the image. In order for the filter to work, we need to change the colors around pixels of the image, so it can look as if it is moving forwards, backwards, or diagnolly.
